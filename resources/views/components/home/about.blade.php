            About Me
          </h2>
          <p class="text-base dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
          Hi there, Iâ€™m Ludovick, a Software Developer who loves to create amazing web and
           mobile applications. I have two years of experience in using cutting-edge technologies such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, Reactjs, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Django and Flutter.</br>
</br>
Whether you need a school management software, a company website, or an event management system, I can build it for you with style and functionality.
</br><br>
I can also design and develop mobile applications using Flutter that will delight your users. I have a solid grasp of advanced 
database design and RBAC authorization, and I can work with MySQL and PostgreSQL seamlessly. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new skills and technologies to learn and master.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
          But thatâ€™s not all. Iâ€™m also a former Sketch artist who can draw stunning portraits and landscapes. I decided to combine my artistic talent 
          with my technical skills by learning Graphics design. Now I can create awesome <span class="text-amber-500 font-bold">Logos, Posters, Videos and Fliers </span>for you that will make your brand stand out.
             <br />
           <br />
            I believe that the best way to learn is by building projects. 
            Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m always working on something new and exciting. If you want to see some of my work, check out my portfolio.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
          If you think Iâ€™m the right person for your project, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. Iâ€™d love to hear from you and discuss how we can work together. Thank you for visiting my profile. Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
